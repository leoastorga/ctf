For this challenge, I used the tool VB Script Coders.exe https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/Decode-VBE-script

Clicked VBE-2-VBS button, selected the vbe file and the tool generated a file called "decoded.vbs". Looking at the "decoded.vbs" source code it was still encoded so changed the extension from .vba to .vbe and decoded it again.
